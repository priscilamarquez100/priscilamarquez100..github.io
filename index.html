			Synopsis for the Page:
		</p>
		<p class="hi">
			Hi! I am Priscila Marquez! I created a website concerning social injustices our society goes through. I decided to advocate for minorities who are in the S.T.E.M field. Minorities deserve the right to succeed in S.T.E.M and should have access to resources! If free education is achievable then S.T.E.M ideas, items, and much more should be free too. Many schools lack to provide challenging courses when it comes to any course, especially Mathematics and Science. Many children fail the CAASP due to the lack of engaging cirriculm needed for S.T.E.M courses. The negative connotation that the S.T.E.M field is that it lacks fun and the complexity factor causes individuals to not join this field. We need to break this and shed the true colors S.T.E.M has to offer. The lack of diversity in this field is gutwrenching. However, I have created this website in order to shed awareness and create solutions on this subject matter! Feel free to click on the other tabs on my navigation bar! I promise you will not regret it! If you need more information or want to know more about who I am, below this message I will post a link to my personal wesbite and on the contact bar you will find all my socials and email.

    Purpose of the Page: 
    </p>

    <p>
      The purpose of the page to bring awareness to these ideas: 
      </p>

      <ul class="Bulletpoints">
      <li> Children from different backgrounds should have the ability to partake in in STEM activities. </li>
      <li> Covid 19 and Racial discrimination has hindered children in finding motivation in S.T.E.M activities! We need to find entertaining and interesting activities that allow children to educate themselves and have fun!
        <li> In my old elementary and middle school, our Math and Science State Test averages are low. A lot of children fail due to the lack of access they have to materials. Moreover, these children come from low-socio economic backgrounds where they worry a lot about surviving-I had to deal with that but I had the opportunity to escape. Not everyone can partake in these fruitful advantage. </li>
        </ul>
